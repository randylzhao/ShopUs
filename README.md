# ShopUs
ShopUs is a site for firms to market their products to consumers through scavenger hunts. Firms can pay to gain exposure by having people participate in scavenger hunts which promote their business. Anyone may sign up to receive clues about a scavenger hunt at our site. Once you find your answer, just send a text back to our number and get your next clue. We used Dwolla for payment services, MongoDB for storing our records, and Twilio for SMS service.
